<h1>Cognitive Telescope Network</h1>
<p>
Telescopic follow-up of transient events is one of the most desirable and scientifically valuable activities in observational astronomy. Transients are often poorly localized in the sky, and telescopes have a limited field of view. Pinpointing the transient source is often daunting. The Cognitive Telescope Network (CTN) will provide the backbone for an intelligent network of telescopes worldwide that can autonomously react to transient astronomical events of interest. </p>

<p>
Examples of transient events are supernovas, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves. CTN aims to capture events for sources like these, selecting the right set of telescopes and instructing them to take photographs of the events.</p>

Both IBM and some USA universities are collaborating on this initiative. It will involve the integration of software controls for the telescope hardware (pointing, camera control, target selection, etc.) and commissions of the telescope for remote use. The system is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible with a  net-zero energy environment. The total amount of energy used for the system and its associated infrastructure is no greater than the on-site renewable energy.</p>
